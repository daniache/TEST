VET CLINIC ORACLE SQL DATABASE

This project involves designing and implementing an information system for a Vet Clinic, aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the clinicâ€™s current processes, such as appointment management, pet registration, and medical record maintenance. It uses a central database to make it easier for the clinic staff and management to enter, find, and use information more efficiently. 

Note: this project does not have a web interface.
